## Developement Outline

Make the Systems

 - The Idle Collection
 - Crafting and Harvesting micro-games
 - Connection
   - The actual act of connecting and syncronizing data.
   - The ability to battle together.
   - Getting the Syncronized data to instantiate and be interactive to Player.
 - Decorating the UserSpace / Island
 - Crafting / Inventory management
 - Battling
   - All the Various Monsters
   - A Combat system
   - Stats
   - Rewards / Unlockables
 - Classes / Jobs Framework
   - Progressions and Abilities

I Wanted to have Multiple Tiers of progress, at least 4. This could translate to Players level as well.

 - Tier 1 = Levels 1 - 4
 - Tier 2 = 5 - 14
 - Tier 3 = 15 - 29
 - Tier 4 = 30 - 99

Since each Tier would involve making whole sets Materials, Monsters, and Abilities; It makes sense to release each Tier as an Update, allowing a Segmented Design/Release.
