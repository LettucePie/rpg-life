# Biomes #

The Player has to choose a Biome in the beginning, and stays with that Biome. Let's say there can be ways to change it, but it shouldn't be a frequent event. Chosen Biomes can add certain specific Materials and Products, sort of real life Culture and Ecosystems. Trying to keep the numbers from exploding out of hand, let's set the amount of Biomes and the expected amount of Unique Materials for each Job within those.

 - Prairie / Plains
 - Tundra
 - Forest
 - Desert
 - Tropics
 - Plateau
 
 There are more biomes in the World.md file, these are just the ones chosen for now. With 13 Jobs currently, and 4 Tiers of Materials; having at least 4 unique materials per tier per job = 1,248 unique materials... Okay so maybe having just 2 Unique Materials per Tier per Job for each Biome...
 
 4 Tiers x 2 Materials = 8
 8 x 6 Biomes = 48
 48 x 13 Jobs = 624
