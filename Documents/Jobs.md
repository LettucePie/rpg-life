# Jobs #

The Player has to choose 2 Jobs in the beginning, and stays with those Jobs. Let's say there can be ways to change them, but it shouldn't be a frequent event. The Jobs dictate what the Player can make, and the materials they can gather by themselves. With the Connection system, this also means what they can contribute to their other players.

Jobs are separate from Combat Roles, however they still contribute abilities in Combat, as well as potential benefits in the Prepartion or Support of battles.
