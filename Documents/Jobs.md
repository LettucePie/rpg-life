# Jobs #

The Player has to choose 2 Jobs in the beginning, and stays with those Jobs. Let's say there can be ways to change them, but it shouldn't be a frequent event. The Jobs dictate what the Player can make, and the materials they can gather by themselves. With the Connection system, this also means what they can contribute to their other players.

Jobs are separate from Combat Roles, however they still contribute abilities in Combat, as well as potential benefits in the Prepartion or Support of battles.

This list aims to clarify the number of Jobs, what abilities they may provide in Combat, and what their Stations will be in the Users Island.

### Brainstorming

Should Foraging be an activity anyone can do? Currently it provides a tremendous variety of materials... 

What about Herbs and Flowers? Should Farmer handle
 - Crops
 - Animal Husbandry
 - Fruit Trees
 - Herbs
 - Flowers

Seems excessive... Perhaps making an Herbologist, or letting the Professor grow plants and other natural findings?
