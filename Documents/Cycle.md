## The Progression Cycle

The Cycle is the gameplay loop that provides rewards which function as utility into achieving the next aspired reward.

At it's base form, it looks like:
 1. Gather Tier 0 Materials
 2. Craft Tier 0 Equipment
 3. Defeat Tier 1 Challenge (Boss)
 4. Repeat **1, 2, and 3** with **+1** to the Tier Level.

In this design we can expand as many times as desired. To keep the size and scope of things in the realm of sanity, we're going to start small.

### FIVE TIERS

Some inspiring examples for what type of quality to expect from each tier...

#### Tier 0

As primitive as possible.
 - Clothing made of plant sinew
 - Furniture made of piles of thatch, large leaves.
 - Tools made of wood
 - Farming almost exclusively easily foraged crops
    - Animal Husbandry is just chicken, and accidental.
 - Jewelry is animal bones
 - Magic is basic Science failing to be scientific

#### Tier 1

Enter Stone Tools
 - Clothing made of Animal Pelt
 - Furniture made of wood
 - Tools made of stone
 - Farming knows how to plant seeds now
 - Magic is difficult to control, almost entirely accidentally summoned.


#### Tier 2
 
Metal is refined, it sucks though
 - Clothing is both animal and actual sewn material like wool
 - Furniture is made of polished wood, chiseled stone
 - Tools made of Copper / Bronze
 - Farming doesn't really advance more here, just add in more crops each tier ` ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ `
 - Jewelry is starting to make actual sense
 - Magic can be controlled but like 2 people can do it and they don't know how.

#### Tier 3

Metal is so Metal dude
 - Clothing is also silk and it's just fine
 - Armor plating kinda sucks but it made it.
 - Furniture is sturdy, it has shiny edges. The door handle is really cold to the touch, it's great.
 - Tools made of Iron
 - Farming can make a cow plow the field, cow never gets paid.
 - Jewelry is having a blast putting little gems in things
 - Magic can be controlled by anyone but it's way too complicated.

#### Tier 4

Steel is so Metal dude
 - Armor is really heavy but so cool
 - Furniture has Glass inserts wow
 - Tools are made of Steel
 - Magic is pretty real, everyone has a Magicphone, even grama is sending ESP texts but they don't make any sense.

#### Tier 5

Oh right this is Fantasy
 - Armor is glowy and enchanted
 - Furniture is glowy and enchanted
 - Tools are glowy and enchanted
 - Cows are glowy and enchanted
 - Jewelry is glowy and enchanted
 - Magic is kind of infiltrating everyone's day to day. Can't get anything to work without connecting it to Magic first and signing in to Spellbook.
