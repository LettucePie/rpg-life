World of RPG-Life

## Document Purpose / Intent ##

This Document aims to provide a solid contextual world and backbone to the Enemies, Designs, and Materials used within RPG-Life. The general aesthetic and flavor of RPG-Life is Medieval Fantasy. There are many potential inspirations to draw from in this genre. I’m not a writer or world-builder, so hopefully this is more Generic/Safe rather than Confusing or Generic/Boring.

## Trestoria Biology ##

Grounded mostly adjacent to Earth, with Magic and Fantasy added on. 

### Background

**Perlin** wandering the cosmos was struck with a fear, it's own mortality. Knowing that all life must eventually end, it sought to prolong it's own death by distracting **True Death** itself. It tried creating life to fill up the queue.

The first few attempts were not entirely successful; often resulting in dead vacant solar systems. Eventually **Perlin** figured it out, although the systems would only die out slower. Perlin was making sophisticated circles of life, but the life would consistently turn afoul; destroying itself. The work of **True Death**? Perlin didn't know.

Trestoria is another attempt, perhaps successful. This time however Perlin introduced divinity and magic. A great risk; not knowing if their creations would rise against.
