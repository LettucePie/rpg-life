## Combat

So there is designated Combat Roles. These roles define your character in Combat, and also affect how you equip them. The Jobs can also interact with combat by adding auxiliary skills. Combat Roles are chosen in the beginning and are not easily changed... if at all.

### Combat Roles

Thinking traditional fantasy rpg, keep it short and sweet for now.

 - Warrior
 - Wizard
 - Cleric
 - Ranger
 - Druid
 - Rogue

Each of these could also have specializations or paths within.

### Battle/Combat System

To keep things moving quickly, battles will not be turn based, but instead active queue. Units in battle will have a speed stat which dictates how quickly they're ready to queue their next action. Actions will have cooldown penalty, which the Speed stat needs to elapse. If multiple players are connected they will all be able to queue in their actions at their own free will.

#### Actions

Each player will be able to bring with them a set number of actions. This forces customization, but also simplifies the experience enough to not be a ton of buttons on screen at all times. Currently I envision the buttons being along the bottom of the screen (phone in portrait mode). Maybe 6 swappable action buttons? The pool of options is occupied by equipment skills, combat role, and jobs.
