# Stations

Stations are the 3D interactables on the Users Island they allow the player to do their Job. Someone with the Farmer Job will have a Farm Station. Ideally these 3D objects will alter in appearance when needing interaction (a glow or outline) and also as the player progresses in their level. Since part of the players identity in their virtual network of other players is reliant on their Jobs chosen; these stations will most likely be required on the players Island, so looks is important.

This document intends to list the Stations and provide brief descriptions for the visual appearance and indicators. In general all stations should look similar between Biomes, maybe with slightly altered details? Stretch goal perhaps...
